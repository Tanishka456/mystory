Once upon a time, in a forest there lived a monkey who resided on a 
Jamoon(berry) tree which was on the banks of thr river.In the same forest, there 
lived a crocodile and his wife.

One day,the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.The crocodile came back the next
day for more fruits as he loved them.As days passed by,the crocodile and the monkey 
became good friends.

One day,the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife.She ate the fruits and 
liked them but was jealous as she did not like her husband spending time with the monkey.
She told her husband,"If the fruits are so juicy,I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be.
Get me the heart of the monkey." The crocodile was not willing to kill his friend,but
had no choice.
